## My process

- I developed the project using HTML & CSS. I used VS Code as my code editor


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

As i was working on the project i realised that in order to grasp the concepts you need to build something to practice what you have learned from the tutorials. That's why these kind of projects are good to learn more and explore.


### Continued development

- Media queries 


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://betterstack.com/community/questions/) - This helped me with git commands and i think i'll be using it in the future for reference purposes.
- [resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website realy helped me finally understand media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
